# Logistic-Regression
## Logistic Regression Model both in Python and R

I used logistic Regression to classify the Social_Media_Ads dataset , and produce two Graphs of training set and test set each so We can do the Analysis properly.

# Remember in Scikit learn Model , from 0.18 version test_train_split Class is not imported from Cross_Validation instead through model_selection
